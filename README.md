I'm a Salesforce Developer with a passion for both front-end and back-end development, especially working with Lightning Web Components (LWC) and Apex. I enjoy building clean, efficient solutions on the Salesforce platform and love diving into integrations that connect systems in powerful ways.

👨🏽‍💻 I’m excited about collaborating on open-source and private web apps.

🌐 Always exploring new ways to bring full-stack ideas to life, both inside and outside Salesforce.
